*Usage Guide:*
- Organise milestones and tasks by epics. These epics will be defined and planned with the user.
- Example structure:
    backlog/
        admin_dashboard/
                comms.md
- Each comms.md file should follow the template in comms_template.md
- The <goal></goal> section should track the milestones needed to complete the epic
- the activity log should document each of the tasks that went into completing the milestones.
