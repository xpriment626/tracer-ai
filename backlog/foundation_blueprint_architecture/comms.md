**Epic**: End-to-End MVP Pipeline - Single Blueprint Validation

Build and validate a complete streamlined workflow: [upload data] -> [train model] -> [receive output] using one focused blueprint, while establishing proper project structure for future development.

**Core Value Validation:**
- âœ… Is there an endpoint I can hit that lets me upload a .csv file?
- âœ… Does that upload trigger the training process?
- âœ… After training, do I get my model back giving me expected outputs?

**Milestones:**
1. **Project Structure & Core Infrastructure** (Week 1)
   - Set up proper project architecture (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
   - Configure development environment and dependencies
   - Create base data ingestion and validation system
   - Establish testing framework

2. **Single Blueprint Implementation** (Week 2)
   - Choose one blueprint (Customer Churn Detection - highest business value)
   - Implement data preprocessing pipeline
   - Build model training workflow
   - Create prediction output system

3. **End-to-End Integration & Testing** (Week 3)
   - API endpoints for CSV data upload
   - Model training orchestration triggered by upload
   - Output delivery system with expected model results
   - Complete workflow testing with real dataset

**Success Criteria:**
- User can upload CSV data via API endpoint
- System automatically triggers model training upon upload
- User receives trained model outputs with expected predictions
- End-to-end workflow completes successfully 3+ times with different datasets
- Project structure supports easy addition of new blueprints

## Action Log

### Planning Phase - 2025-07-22
- âœ… Analyzed project context and strategic pivot requirements
- âœ… Refined epic scope to focused end-to-end MVP approach
- âœ… Defined three core milestones: Infrastructure -> Implementation -> Integration
- âœ… Chose Customer Churn Detection as the single blueprint focus
- âœ… Clarified core value proposition: streamlined pipeline, not speed optimization
- âœ… Established clear success criteria focused on pipeline validation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Set up project structure and begin infrastructure milestone
