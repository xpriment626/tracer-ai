# MVP Sprint Plan: SQM Framework with Model 1 as Foundation

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Build Model 1 (Match Winner Prediction) not just as a model, but as the foundational example of a pioneering SQM framework designed for the agentic application ecosystem.

**Timeline**: 4-week sprint
**Budget**: $500 for data and model training
**Philosophy**: Model 1 is our flagship - built production-ready with future extensibility in mind, while everything else can be scrappy

## Core Principles

### Model 1 as Infrastructure Pioneer
- **Not just a model, but a framework**: Build the scaffolding for an entire SQM ecosystem
- **Agent-first design**: Every component designed for seamless integration with AI agents
- **Extensibility from day one**: Architecture that anticipates Models 2-5 and beyond
- **Production-grade where it matters**: Model 1 gets full treatment, UI can be minimal

## Sprint Overview (4 Weeks)

### Week 1: SQM Framework Architecture
**Goal**: Build the foundational infrastructure that Model 1 will exemplify

#### Core Framework Components

```

#### Key Design Decisions
- **Semantic Output Format**: Predictions include reasoning chains for agent consumption
- **Version Control**: Git-like model versioning with full reproducibility
- **Modular Architecture**: Plug-and-play components for future models
- **Standard Interfaces**: Every SQM follows same prediction/evaluation interface

### Week 2: Model 1 Implementation
**Goal**: Implement Match Winner Prediction as the exemplar SQM

#### Data Strategy (Within $500 Budget)
1. **Primary Source**: 
   - Use free tier of PandaScore API (1000 requests/month)
   - Focus on League of Legends (most data available)
   - Target 5,000 historical matches

2. **Supplementary Data**:
   - Scrape public match results from Leaguepedia (free)
   - Use community datasets from Kaggle
   - Total estimated cost: $200-300 for any paid API overages

#### Model Architecture
```python
class MatchWinnerSQM(BaseSQM):
    """
    Flagship SQM implementation demonstrating all framework features
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            model_id="match_winner_v1",
            model_type="binary_classification",
            interpretability_enabled=True
        )
        
    # Features demonstrating framework capabilities:
    # - Automatic feature versioning
    # - Built-in data validation
    # - Integrated A/B testing
    # - Agent-friendly explanations
```

#### Feature Engineering Pipeline
- **Core Features** (15-20 total):
  - Team ELO ratings (calculated from historical data)
  - Recent form (last 5 matches)
  - Head-to-head record
  - Player roster stability
  - Tournament importance weighting

- **Framework Features**:
  - Automatic feature importance tracking
  - Feature drift detection
  - Version-controlled feature definitions

### Week 3: Integration & API Development
**Goal**: Build the serving layer and basic UI

#### API Design (Agent-First)
```yaml
/predict/match_winner:
  response:
    prediction: 0.73
    confidence: 0.82
    team_a_win_probability: 0.73
    explanation:
      top_factors:
        - factor: "recent_form"
          impact: 0.31
          description: "Team A won 4 of last 5 matches"
        - factor: "elo_difference"
          impact: 0.27
          description: "Team A has 127 point ELO advantage"
    metadata:
      model_version: "1.2.3"
      feature_version: "2.1.0"
      training_date: "2024-01-15"
```

#### Minimal UI Strategy
